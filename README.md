I'm a technical professional with a broad set of skills across development, cloud operations, application security, system administration, and engineering management. I specialize in bridging the gap with business leaders on initiatives that require a high degree of coordination among multiple technical teams.

I'm graduating from Vanderbilt University with a M.S. in Computer Science in May of 2024, and I'm exploring machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts while continuing to grow my knowledge base around existing skills.

Please don't hesitate to email me with questions, comments, or collaboration opportunities @ [john.ford2002@gmail.com](mailto:john.ford2002@gmail.com).
